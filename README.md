# Computer-Architecture-Lab
The course project: Implementation of ARM968E-S processor
The project consists of four main parts:
Basics of ARM: The initial implementation focusing on the foundational aspects of ARM architecture.
Forwarding: Enhancements to the basic ARM model by incorporating data forwarding techniques to resolve data hazards.
SRAM Integration: Addition of SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) to the existing ARM model.
Cache Implementation: Final part of the project which includes the implementation of a cache memory system.
